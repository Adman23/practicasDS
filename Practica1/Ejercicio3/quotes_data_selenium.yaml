  Quote: "\u201CThis life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess\
    \ up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide\
    \ how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like\
    \ it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you\
    \ through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also\
    \ remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll\
    \ come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty\
    \ much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because\
    \ if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half\
    \ who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once,\
    \ doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always,\
    \ always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie?\
    \ So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling,\
    \ because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.\u201D"

  Quote: "\u201CYou may not be her first, her last, or her only. She loved before\

    you aren't either, and the two of you may never be perfect together but if she\
    \ can make you laugh, cause you to think twice, and admit to being human and making\
    \ mistakes, hold onto her and give her the most you can. She may not be thinking\
    \ about you every second of the day, but she will give you a part of her that\
    \ she knows you can break\u2014her heart. So don't hurt her, don't change her,\
    \ don't analyze and don't expect more than she can give. Smile when she makes\
    \ you happy, let her know when she makes you mad, and miss her when she's not\
